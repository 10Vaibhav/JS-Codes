# Next.js Technical Reference

## Introduction to Next.js
Next.js is a React framework created by Vercel that enhances React with server-side rendering, routing, and build optimization. It enables developers to create production-ready React applications with improved performance and SEO capabilities.

## SEO Optimization
Next.js improves search engine optimization through server-rendered HTML which makes content immediately indexable by search engines. The framework's metadata API allows precise control of title tags, meta descriptions, and OpenGraph data, significantly boosting search visibility.

## Waterfalling Problem
The waterfalling problem occurs when network requests are executed sequentially, causing cumulative delays in page rendering. Next.js solves this by enabling parallel data fetching with Server Components and providing data streaming capabilities that allow parts of the page to load independently.

## Next.js Core Offerings
- **App Router**: Next.js 13+ routing system based on file-system hierarchy with enhanced features like nested layouts and loading states.
- **Server Components**: React components that render on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance.
- **API Routes**: Serverless functions that run on the backend, enabling secure API endpoints within your Next.js application.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image resizing, optimization, and modern format delivery based on browser support.
- **Font Optimization**: Zero layout shift font loading with automatic self-hosting of Google Fonts and other providers.

## Bootstrapping a Next.js Application
Creating a new Next.js application requires Node.js 16.8+ and can be done with the create-next-app CLI tool. This sets up the project structure with essential configurations and dependencies, offering options for TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS integration.

## Routing in Next.js
Next.js uses file-system based routing where directories and files in the app/ folder (or pages/ in the older system) define application routes. Special file naming conventions like page.js, layout.js, and loading.js serve specific purposes within the routing system.

## Server-Side Rendering
Server-side rendering (SSR) generates HTML for each request on the server before sending it to the client. Next.js supports multiple rendering strategies including SSR, Static Site Generation (pre-rendering at build time), and Incremental Static Regeneration (updating static content after deployment).

## Layouts in Next.js
Layouts in Next.js are UI components that wrap page content and remain consistent across multiple pages. The App Router allows nested layouts where parent layouts wrap child layouts, enabling complex UI hierarchies while preserving state and preventing unnecessary re-renders during navigation.
