# Next.js Concepts - Quick Definitions

## API Routes in Next.js

Server-side endpoints built within your Next.js application that handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and return responses. They allow you to create backend functionality without a separate server.

## Frontend for Signing Up

The client-side user interface components and forms that collect user registration information (email, password, name) and send it to the backend API for account creation.

## Databases

External data storage systems (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) that persist user information, application data, and other records outside of your application code.

## Singleton Prisma Client

A design pattern that ensures only one instance of the Prisma database client exists throughout your application, preventing multiple database connections and potential memory issues during development.
